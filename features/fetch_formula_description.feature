Feature: Fetch formula description
  In order to understand what is the purpose of a formula
  As a robot
  I want to fetch it from the formula homepage
  So that it can be shown on brewformulas.org

  Scenario Outline: Fetch formula description from homepage
    Given following Homebrew formula exists:
      | filename | <filename> |
      | name     | <name>     |
      | homepage | <homepage> |
    When the background task to fetch formula description runs
    Then the formula <name> should have the following description:
    """
    <description>
    """
  Examples:
    | filename      | name        | homepage                                                         | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It can be easily adapted to execute under any host OS. The ACPICA code is meant to be directly integrated into the host OS as a kernel-resident subsystem. Hosting the ACPICA subsystem requires no changes to the core ACPICA code. Instead, a small OS-specific interface layer is written specifically for each host OS in order to interface the ACPICA code to the native OS services.                             |

This software will tell you which switch and port your device is plugged into. It is known to compile and run on Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, AIX and Windows (using pcap). In verbose mode, it decodes the entire CDP packet including information such as native VLAN, device capabilities, etc. It also has the ability to report the data back to a server so that you can use CDPR to keep an ever updating database of which devices are on which switch port. This code has had several additions made to it at the request of Cisco and is used in many of their labs. |
